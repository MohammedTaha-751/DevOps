# # Hello World App

This is a simple Java program that prints "Hello World!" to the console. The `App` class is part of the `org.example` package and contains a method `getGreeting()` which returns the greeting string. The program starts from the `main` method, where an instance of the `App` class is created, `getGreeting()` is called, and the result is printed using `System.out.println()`. When run, the application displays the message "Hello World!" in the console.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/main/java/org/example/App.java
